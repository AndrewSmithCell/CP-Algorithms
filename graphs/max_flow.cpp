//In the max flow problem, we have a directed graph with a source node s and a sink node t, and each edge has a capacity that represents the maximum amount of flow that can be sent through it. The goal is to find the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from s to t, while respecting the capacity constraints on the edges.
// Solution to this problem of maximum flow is Ford Fulkerson Algorithm or a varaint called Edmonds-Karp algorithm
